## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Google Fonts (Figtree)

### What I learned

During this project, I focused on:

- Improving my ability to create responsive, mobile-first layouts using Flexbox.
- Implementing hover and focus states effectively to improve the user experience.
- Using custom properties in CSS to make the design more maintainable and flexible.

For example, I learned how to implement hover on the heading and tag:

```css
h1:hover {
    color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}

.tag:hover {
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
    color: hsl(47, 88%, 63%);
}
```
